	// The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be returned. By default response_view is BASIC; not all information is retrieved by default because some data, such as payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it contains. Authorization for FULL requires `cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/) permission on the Task resource.
	ResponseView *string `pulumi:"responseView"`
	// Required. The task to add. Task names have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID`. The user can optionally specify a task name. If a name is not specified then the system will generate a random unique task id, which will be set in the task returned in the response. If schedule_time is not set or is in the past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current time. Task De-duplication: Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication. If a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task that was deleted or completed recently then the call will fail with ALREADY_EXISTS. If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~1hour after the original task was deleted or completed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~9days after the original task was deleted or completed. Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task names, these CreateTask calls have significantly increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately uniform distribution of task ids to store and serve tasks efficiently.
